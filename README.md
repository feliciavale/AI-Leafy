# Leafy: Plant Identification using Pre-Trained AI Models
Leafy is an AI-powered mobile application designed to help users identify plant species easily. By leveraging a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the app allows users to simply take a photo of a plant to receive instant identification, along with key information.

The project utilizes the TensorFlow Object Detection API with a SSD MobileNet V1 backbone for efficient object detection, making it suitable for portable devices.

# Key Features
- One-Click Identification: Quickly identify plants by taking a picture or uploading one from your gallery.
- AI-Powered Recognition: Employs a pre-trained CNN model for high-accuracy plant detection.
- Simple & Intuitive Interface: Designed for a clean, straightforward user experience.
- Educational Tool: Provides scientific classification and a direct link to Wikipedia for more in-depth information about the plant.
